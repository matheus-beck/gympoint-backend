## Getting started
1. Clone the project into your machine and install all dependencies inside the `backend` folder using:
```console
yarn install
```

2. Now, run these three Docker containers in your machine:
```console
sudo docker run --name gympoint -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
sudo docker run --name redisgym -p 6379:6379 -d -t redis:alpine
```

3. You also have to create a database called 'gympoint' inside the PostgreSQL ([Here is an example using Postbird](https://matheus-beck.github.io/blog/docker/postgresql/postbird/sequelize/2019/09/11/configuring-postgres-docker-postbird-sequelize.html)) and create the tables using:
```console
yarn sequelize db:migrate
```

4. Rename the `.env.example` file for `.env` and put your credentials inside the `.env`

5. Finally, to run the server: 

```console
yarn dev
```

6. And to run the mail queue:

```console
yarn queue
```
